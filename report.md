3. Establish secure channel
4. Begin encrypted communication

### Key Rotation
1. Periodic key rotation (every 15 minutes)
2. New key distribution via CA
3. Backup key management
4. Seamless transition

### Message Security
1. HMAC message authentication
2. Cipher selection flexibility

- Manages game sessions

### Player Connection
CLI Version:
```bash
python player.py <player_name>
```

GUI Version:
```bash
python gui_player.py <player_name>
```

### Quick Start
```bash
python launcher.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions
1. Wait for player connection (2 players required)
2. Follow color input format: RED,BLUE,GREEN,YELLOW,BLACK
3. Watch for feedback after each guess
4. First correct guess wins
